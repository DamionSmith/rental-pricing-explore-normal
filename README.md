## Project Description
* During or "exploratory data analysis" (EDA) process we had to import our realestae.xlsx file to provide us with our proper dataset. Doing so allows us to read the dataset and extract important things like the datatype and also a selective summary of the data. further in the process, we generated various visualizations like sctterplots,boxplots, histographs, heatmaps and metrics to get to know our dataset better. After we must start to prepare the data for cleaning. In our data preperation phase we cleaned our dataset by fixing various errors that presented itself. Removing and dropping alot of things from the dataframe and then again gnerate vizualtions and metrics to view the new dataframe properly. Furthermore after creating our .csv file we now approach the final steps of exploring this data which is linear regression. Linear progression helps us predict the renatl housing prices better, by creating and scoring a model which we searlize and finally save..
